\frametitle{\LaTeX{} overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item \LaTeX is a system for typesetting mathematical, technical and general purpose documents. 
\item \LaTeX serves the same purpose as Microsoft's Word/Microsoft PowerPoint or the google docs document editor.
\item While Microsoft Word and google docs are ``what-you-see-is-what-you-get'' systems.
\item In contrast, \LaTeX's work flow has two parts: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Enter the text/presentation you want displayed in a \LaTeX editor.
\item Compile your text to obtain a (usually pdf) file your resulting presentation.
\end{itemize}
\item The \LaTeX work flow is a blend between (easy) computer programming and text-editing.
\end{itemize}
