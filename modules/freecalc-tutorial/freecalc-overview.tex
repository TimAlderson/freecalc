\item The freecalc project is a set of teaching materials:
\begin{itemize}
\item Teaching slides.

\item In preparation: textbook(s).
\end{itemize}
\item Goal: cover the standard mathematical high school and university curriculum. As of Summer 2017, we've covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Precalculus (trigonometry, polynomials, function basics).
\item Calculus I (differentiation, integration).
\item Calculus II (integration, curves, basic differential equations).
\item Vector/Multivariable Calculus (double, triple integrals, curve/surface integrals, Green's, Stokes's and Divergence Theorems).
\end{itemize}
\item History of the project (Summer 2017).
\begin{itemize}
\item Started by Greg Maloney at the U. of Massachusetts Boston.
\item Todor Milev took over the project in 2013.
